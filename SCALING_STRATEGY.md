## 📊 Revenue Model

### Primary Revenue Streams

| Stream | Fee | Projected % of Revenue |
|--------|-----|------------------------|
| **Protocol Fees** | 2.5% of all transactions | 60% |
| **Premium Listings** | $99-999/month | 15% |
| **Enterprise Plans** | $5K-50K/month | 15% |
| **Verification Badges** | $199 one-time | 5% |
| **API Access Tiers** | $49-499/month | 5% |

### Revenue Calculation: Path to $1M/Day

```
Daily Transaction Volume Needed:
$1,000,000 ÷ 2.5% fee = $40,000,000 daily volume

At average transaction of $5:
$40,000,000 ÷ $5 = 8,000,000 transactions/day

At average transaction of $0.50:
$40,000,000 ÷ $0.50 = 80,000,000 transactions/day
```

**Target: $40M daily transaction volume** (achievable with 10K active agents averaging $4K/day each)
